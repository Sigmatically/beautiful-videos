This project will read over commonly visited websites I go to, gather data about new videos that have been submitted to those sites, filter out videos I commonly don't watch, and neatly place information regarding those videos in a dataframe to be written to either an excel file, csv file, or text file.

While making my life easier, this project is also for practice with the APIWebsite request library requests and with the Beautiful Soup library.
